Hi, my name is David and Iâ€™m a Junior Front-End Developer eager to continue developing as a programmer. Broad resolution skills, calm, creative personality and responsible worker.
My initial career path was to study three years of illustration and digital drawing, which allowed me to further develop certain capacities such as empathy, creativity and self-criticism. I did afterwards return to programming by signing up for the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, where Iâ€™ve learned under the mantle of great professionals and sharing team activities and projects with extraordinary and brilliant colleagues.
